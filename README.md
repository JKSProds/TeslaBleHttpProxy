# TeslaBleHttpProxy

TeslaBleHttpProxy is a program written in Go that receives HTTP requests and forwards them via Bluetooth to a Tesla vehicle. The program can, for example, be easily used together with [evcc](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc).

This program is a fork of the main TeslaBleHttpProxy with some changes so it works correctly with EVCC.
